    <h3>Here are some possible weights for a ZZW30</h3>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Toyota's claimed OEM Weight: 2,195 lb (996 kg)</li>
        <li>Stripped weight: 1,895 lb (859 kg). <a href="https://www.spyderchat.com/threads/a-stripped-out-spyder-weighs-x-xxx-lbs-see-inside.51309/" target="_blank">Credit to Seth Crawford</a></li> 
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Here are some steps to remove weight:</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove front compartment spare tire, tire bucket, and plastic surrounds.</li>
        <li>Remove the passenger seat.</li>
        <li>Consider replacing exhaust components like the header and catalytic converter.</li>
        <li>Consider installing a lightweight battery</li>
        <li>Remove the soft top entirely. You may want to consider getting a carbon hardtop.</li>
        <li>Remove the interior panels, such as the door cards, center console, rear bins, carpet, and dash. For racing purposes, the airbag may also be removed.</li>
        <li>Consider getting coilovers as they are marginally lighter than the OEM suspension</li>
    </ol>
